# HealthCare.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook provides healthcare and finance data analysis using Python’s data handling and visualization libraries. It includes simulation and visualization of medical data (blood pressure, test scores), financial tracking (spending by categories), and classic education analytics (class performance, outlier detection).

***

## Overview

- Analysis and visualization of synthetic health, finance, and education datasets  
- Generating, interpreting, and visualizing time series, box plots, bar graphs, and pie charts  
- Basic outlier and trend detection for educational and healthcare data

***

## Features

- **Blood Pressure Analytics**: Simulates readings, plots trends, and finds months with highest/lowest values  
- **Financial Expenditure**: Tracks monthly/annual spending by category, visualizes with pie charts and line plots  
- **Student Test Scores**: Generates test score distributions, identifies outliers, interprets box plots  
- **Classroom Analysis**: Simulates class averages, visualizes with bar plots, determines best/worst performing groups  
- **Combined Trend Visualization**: Plots health and finance trends on the same chart for comparative analysis

***

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - pandas (if required, not explicitly listed in the output)
  - seaborn (if used for advanced plots)

To install requirements (recommended inside a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

If your notebook uses pandas or seaborn, add:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn
```

***

## Usage

1. Open the notebook with Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook HealthCare.ipynb
   ```
2. Each section can be run independently, generating plots or outputs for:
   - Blood pressure monitoring
   - Monthly and categorical financial analytics
   - Class score simulation and visualization
   - Outlier analysis in student test scores
3. Review the interpretation printed within each cell for statistical summary and outlier identification

***

## Dataset

- Data used in the notebook is synthetically generated using NumPy’s random functions for demonstration
- No real personal or clinical data required

***

## Output & Interpretation

- **Trends**: Line plots differentiate health and finance trends with color and legends
- **Category Breakdowns**: Pie charts explain finance category splits
- **Box Plots**: Show distribution, quartiles, and highlight statistical outliers
- **Bar Plots**: Rank classes by average score
- Statistical summaries are printed per section: quartiles, outlier counts, and max/min indicators

***

## Results and Insights

- Identify trends over time in health and finance
- Detect anomalies and outliers in education/medical data
- Visual interpretation clarifies statistical findings

***

## Author

- Created as an educational template for healthcare and finance analytics using Python/Jupyter
